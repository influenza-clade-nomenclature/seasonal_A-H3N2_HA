# 2024-11-12

This update adds additional subclades to split up J.1 and J.2. Specifically, the subclade nomenclature now includes
 - `J.1.1` with substitutions HA1:145N and HA2:89SI
 - `J.2.1` with substitutions HA1 79L and 229S
 - `J.2.2` with substitutions HA1 124N

# 2024-02-22
After discussion with various members of the seasonal influenza virus surveillance community, it was decided that subclade names starting with `H` have the potential to be confused with major influenza hemagglutinin subtypes. These subclades where therefore renamed to start with the alias `J`.

 - `H` --> `J`
 - `H.1` --> `J.1`
 - `H.2` --> `J.2`
 - `H.3` --> `J.3`
 - `H.4` --> `J.4`

The subclades `H` and `H.*` were revoked, and a comment was added to explain the reason. No subclade definitions were changed.

# 2023-12-19

The recent dominance of subclade H and the emergence of several distinct groups within H triggered the new designation of subclades H.1, H.2, H.3, H.4.
